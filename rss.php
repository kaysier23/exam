			<title>First-of-its-kind hydrogel platform enables on-demand production of medicines, chemicals</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/02/200209155505.htm</link>
			<description>A team of chemical engineers has developed a new way to produce medicines and chemicals on demand and preserve them using portable &#039;&#039;biofactories&#039;&#039; embedded in water-based gels called hydrogels. The approach could help people in remote villages or on military missions, where the absence of pharmacies, doctor&#039;s offices or even basic refrigeration makes it hard to access critical medicines, daily use chemicals and other small-molecule compounds. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>No clear path for golden rice to reach consumers</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/02/200207153632.htm</link>
			<description>Heralded as a genetically modified crop with the potential to save millions of lives, Golden Rice has just been approved as safe for human and animal consumption by regulators in the Philippines. The rice is a beta carotene-enriched crop that is intended to reduce Vitamin A deficiency (VAD), a health problem in very poor areas. But a new study finds that most families at risk for VAD can&#039;t grow Golden Rice themselves, and most commercial farmers won&#039;t grow it either. <!-- more --></description>

			<description>For the first time, researchers have simulated the formation of galaxies in a universe without dark matter. To replicate this process on the computer, they have instead modified Newton&#039;s laws of gravity. The galaxies that were created in the computer calculations are similar to those we actually see today. According to the scientists, their assumptions could solve many mysteries of modern cosmology. <!-- more --></description>

The study, which surveyed nearly 1,000 Canadians aged 16 to 30, found that most consumers could not identify whether a cannabis edible contained &#039;low&#039; or &#039;high&#039; levels of THC based on the label. <!-- more --></description>

			<description>Photosensitizers absorb sunlight and pass that energy along to generate electricity or drive chemical reactions. Scientists watched what happened when light hit an inexpensive photosensitizer, iron carbene, and discovered it can respond in two competing ways, only one only one of which allows electrons to flow into the devices or reactions where they&#039;re needed. It took this desired path about 60% of the time. The ultimate goal is to design cheap photosensitizers for specific tasks that are close to 100% efficient. <!-- more --></description>

			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/02/200206152811.htm</link>
			<description>Proposed a century ago, inverse transitions seem to contradict the fundamental law that disorder increases with temperature. They have been found in superconductors and liquid crystals, but not yet in ferroelectric materials, which have a variety of uses in electronics and data storage. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>Engineered living-cell blood vessel provides new insights to progeria</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/02/200206144843.htm</link>
			<description>Scientists have developed the most advanced disease model for blood vessels to date and used it to discover a unique role of the endothelium in Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome. This devastating and extremely rare genetic disease causes symptoms resembling accelerated aging in children. The model is the first to grow both the smooth muscle and inner lining, or endothelium, layers of blood vessels from stem cells derived from the patients&#039; own skin. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>Toxic protein, linked to Alzheimer&#039;s and neurodegenerative diseases, exposed in new detail</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/02/200206144841.htm</link>
			<description>The protein tau has long been implicated in Alzheimer&#039;s and a host of other debilitating brain diseases. But scientists have struggled to understand exactly how tau converts from its normal, functional form into a misfolded, harmful one. By analyzing brain tissue from patients, researchers have revealed that modifications to the tau protein may influence what type of disease that will develop -- and how quickly that disease will spread throughout the brain. <!-- more --></description>

			<description>From plastics to pesticides, it seems like every week delivers fresh news about the dangers of endocrine disruptors -- chemicals in the environment that alter the body&#039;s hormones and can lead to reproductive, developmental, neurologic and immune problems and cancer. Industry regulation and individual consumer choice can reduce exposure to such chemicals, but there are few options to counteract damage that has already occurred. Now new research conducted in worms suggests a path toward changing that. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>Water-conducting membrane allows carbon dioxide to transform into fuel more efficiently</title>

			<description>Methanol is a versatile and efficient chemical used as fuel in the production of countless products. Carbon dioxide, on the other hand, is a greenhouse gas that is the unwanted byproduct of many industrial processes. Converting carbon dioxide to methanol is one way to put carbon dioxide to good use. Chemical engineers have now demonstrated how to make that conversion process more efficient by using a highly effective separation membrane they produced. <!-- more --></description>

			<description>Scientists used biochemical experiments and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to determine the atomic structure of a complex assembly of molecules known as the histone mRNA three-prime (3&#039;) end-processing machine. This machine plays a fundamental role in proper activity and duplication of the cell genome and when defective, it may lead to human diseases, including cancers. <!-- more --></description>

			<description>Researchers have created a new technique that shows which species will be at risk from climate change, where those risks are most severe, and even suggests things we can do to reduce those risks. The method to predict extinction risk works very well for bumble bees and could in theory be applied universally to other organisms. <!-- more --></description>

			<description>A new study shows classrooms remain overlooked when it comes to the health risks of sitting still for too long. Researchers found most students don&#039;t realize the health risks can&#039;t be counteracted by later exercise, and perhaps unsurprisingly, students feel it is socially unacceptable to take a walk while the professor is still leading class. The researchers have solutions like building open classrooms and offering instructor-led stretch breaks. <!-- more --></description>
