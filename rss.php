			<description>The need to efficiently harvest solar energy for a more sustainable future is increasingly becoming accepted across the globe. A new family of solar cells based on perovskites -- materials with a particular crystal structure -- is now competing with conventional silicon materials to satisfy the demand in this area. Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are continually being optimized to fulfill their commercial potential. <!-- more --></description>

			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/02/200210104116.htm</link>
			<description>High magnetic fields have a potential to modify the microscopic arrangement of magnetic moments because they overcome interactions existing in zero field. Usually, high fields exceeding a certain critical value force the moments to align in the same direction as the field leading to ferromagnetic arrangement. However, a recent study showed that this is not always the case. <!-- more --></description>

			<description>Destabilizing the precarious equilibrium at depth with geothermal wells may reactivate the geological layers causing earthquakes. Researchers have studied the seismic activity linked to a geothermal drilling in search of supercritical fluids. They discovered that the drilling did not cause uncontrolled seismic activity. This drilling under such critical conditions suggests that the technology is on the verge of mastering geothermal energy, paving the way for new sources of non-polluting heat and electricity. <!-- more --></description>

A new study focusing on the humble, but ecologically key, dung beetle has revealed for the first time that intense droughts and wildfires during the last El NiÃƒÂ±o climate phenomenon, combined with human disturbance, led to beetle numbers falling by more than half -- with effects lasting for at least two years. <!-- more --></description>

To replicate this process on the computer, they have instead modified Newton&#039;s laws of gravity. The galaxies that were created in the computer calculations are similar to those we actually see today.

			<description>Scientists devised a novel single-cell genomic sequencing technique that enables detailed, functional analysis of uncultured bacteria and identified bacterial responders of dietary fiber inulin in mouse gut microbiota. This technique could be applied to predict the metabolic fermentation of dietary fibers based on the presence and ability of specific responders and be exploited to improve human and animal health in the future. <!-- more --></description>

			<description>Scientists have shown that copper oxide particles on the sub-nanoscale are more powerful catalysts than those on the nanoscale. These subnanoparticles can also catalyze the oxidation reactions of aromatic hydrocarbons far more effectively than catalysts currently used in industry. This study paves the way to better and more efficient utilization of aromatic hydrocarbons, which are important materials for both research and industry. <!-- more --></description>

			<description>An international team has used neutron and X-ray tomography to investigate the dynamic processes that lead to capacity degradation at the electrodes in lithium batteries. Using a new mathematical method, it was possible to virtually unwind electrodes that had been wound into the form of a compact cylinder, and thus actually observe the processes on the surfaces of the electrodes. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>How iron carbenes store energy from sunlight -- and why they aren&#039;t better at it</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/02/200206155827.htm</link>
			<description>Photosensitizers absorb sunlight and pass that energy along to generate electricity or drive chemical reactions. Scientists watched what happened when light hit an inexpensive photosensitizer, iron carbene, and discovered it can respond in two competing ways, only one only one of which allows electrons to flow into the devices or reactions where they&#039;re needed. It took this desired path about 60% of the time. The ultimate goal is to design cheap photosensitizers for specific tasks that are close to 100% efficient. <!-- more --></description>
