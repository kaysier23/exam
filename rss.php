			<title>Not everything is ferromagnetic in high magnetic fields</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/02/200210104116.htm</link>
			<description>High magnetic fields have a potential to modify the microscopic arrangement of magnetic moments because they overcome interactions existing in zero field. Usually, high fields exceeding a certain critical value force the moments to align in the same direction as the field leading to ferromagnetic arrangement. However, a recent study showed that this is not always the case. <!-- more --></description>

			<description>Destabilizing the precarious equilibrium at depth with geothermal wells may reactivate the geological layers causing earthquakes. Researchers have studied the seismic activity linked to a geothermal drilling in search of supercritical fluids. They discovered that the drilling did not cause uncontrolled seismic activity. This drilling under such critical conditions suggests that the technology is on the verge of mastering geothermal energy, paving the way for new sources of non-polluting heat and electricity. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>How iron carbenes store energy from sunlight -- and why they aren&#039;t better at it</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/02/200206155827.htm</link>
			<description>Photosensitizers absorb sunlight and pass that energy along to generate electricity or drive chemical reactions. Scientists watched what happened when light hit an inexpensive photosensitizer, iron carbene, and discovered it can respond in two competing ways, only one only one of which allows electrons to flow into the devices or reactions where they&#039;re needed. It took this desired path about 60% of the time. The ultimate goal is to design cheap photosensitizers for specific tasks that are close to 100% efficient. <!-- more --></description>

			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/02/200207124454.htm</link>
			<description>For the first time, researchers have simulated the formation of galaxies in a universe without dark matter. To replicate this process on the computer, they have instead modified Newton&#039;s laws of gravity. The galaxies that were created in the computer calculations are similar to those we actually see today. According to the scientists, their assumptions could solve many mysteries of modern cosmology. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>How iron carbenes store energy from sunlight -- and why they aren&#039;t better at it</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/02/200206155827.htm</link>
			<description>Photosensitizers absorb sunlight and pass that energy along to generate electricity or drive chemical reactions. Scientists watched what happened when light hit an inexpensive photosensitizer, iron carbene, and discovered it can respond in two competing ways, only one only one of which allows electrons to flow into the devices or reactions where they&#039;re needed. It took this desired path about 60% of the time. The ultimate goal is to design cheap photosensitizers for specific tasks that are close to 100% efficient. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>Fireproof, lightweight solid electrolyte for safer lithium-ion batteries</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/02/200205084155.htm</link>
			<description>Lithium-ion batteries are in everything from cell phones to cars. However, recent incidents involving fires or explosions of these devices show there&#039;s a need for safer batteries. One option is to replace the flammable liquid electrolyte with a solid-state electrolyte (SSE). But some of the most-studied SSEs are themselves flammable, leaving the original safety concern unaddressed. Researchers now report that they have developed an SSE that won&#039;t burn up. <!-- more --></description>
