			<title>One small grain of moon dust, one giant leap for lunar studies</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/02/200207095427.htm</link>
			<description>Scientists have found a new way to analyze the chemistry of the moon&#039;s soil using a single grain of dust brought back by Apollo 17 astronauts in 1972. Their technique can help us learn more about conditions on the surface of the moon and formation of precious resources like water and helium there. <!-- more --></description>

			<description>Bumblebees are the big lifters of the insect world, able to fly back to the hive with almost their own bodyweight in nectar on board. A new study shows how they do it -- and that bees can show more flexibility in behavior than you might expect from a bumbling insect. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>New droplet-based electricity generator: A drop of water generates 140V power, lighting up 100 LED bulbs</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/02/200205132354.htm</link>
			<description>Generating electricity from raindrops efficiently has gone one step further. A research team has recently developed a droplet-based electricity generator (DEG), featured with a field-effect transistor (FET)-like structure that allows for high energy-conversion efficiency and instantaneous power density increased by thousands times compared to its counterparts without FET-like structure. This would help to advance scientific research of water energy generation and tackle the energy crisis. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>Discovery sheds new light on how cells move</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/01/200124124508.htm</link>
			<description>Through experiments, researchers found that the force each cell applies to the surface beneath it -- in other words, traction -- is the dominant physical factor that controls cell shape and motion as cells travel as a group. <!-- more --></description>

			<description>Astronomers have detected large amounts of oxygen in the atmosphere of one of the oldest and most elementally depleted stars known. This new finding provides an important clue on how oxygen and other important elements were produced in the first generations of stars in the universe. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>Sea level rise could reshape the United States, trigger migration inland</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/01/200122150021.htm</link>
			<description>A new study uses machine learning to project migration patterns resulting from sea-level rise. Researchers found the impact of rising oceans will ripple across the country, beyond coastal areas at risk of flooding, as affected people move inland. Popular relocation choices will include land-locked cities such as Atlanta, Houston, Dallas, Denver and Las Vegas. The model also predicts suburban and rural areas in the Midwest will experience disproportionately large influx of people relative to their smaller local populations. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>Solving a biological puzzle: How stress causes gray hair</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/01/200122135313.htm</link>
			<description>Scientists have found evidence to support long-standing anecdotes that stress causes hair graying. Researchers found that in mice, the type of nerve involved in the fight-or-flight response causes permanent damage to the pigment-regenerating stem cells in the hair follicle. The findings advance knowledge of how stress impacts the body, and are a first step toward blocking its negative effects. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>Earth&#039;s oldest asteroid strike linked to &#039;big thaw&#039;</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/01/200122100546.htm</link>
			<description>Scientists have discovered Earth&#039;s oldest asteroid strike occurred at Yarrabubba, in outback Western Australia, and coincided with the end of a global deep freeze known as a Snowball Earth. The research used isotopic analysis of minerals to calculate the precise age of the Yarrabubba crater for the first time, putting it at 2.229 billion years old -- making it 200 million years older than the next oldest impact. <!-- more --></description>

A new study shows that infested tomato plants, in their efforts to fight off caterpillars, don&#039;t adapt well to rising temperatures. This double-edged sword worsens their productivity. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>Dozens of non-oncology drugs can kill cancer cells</title>

			<description>Researchers tested approximately 4,518 drug compounds on 578 human cancer cell lines and found nearly 50 that have previously unrecognized anti-cancer activity. These drugs have been used to treat conditions such as diabetes, inflammation, alcoholism, and even arthritis in dogs. The findings suggest a possible way to accelerate the development of new cancer drugs or repurpose existing drugs to treat cancer. <!-- more --></description>
