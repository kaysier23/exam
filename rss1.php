			<title>First-of-its-kind hydrogel platform enables on-demand production of medicines, chemicals</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/02/200209155505.htm</link>
			<description>A team of chemical engineers has developed a new way to produce medicines and chemicals on demand and preserve them using portable &#039;&#039;biofactories&#039;&#039; embedded in water-based gels called hydrogels. The approach could help people in remote villages or on military missions, where the absence of pharmacies, doctor&#039;s offices or even basic refrigeration makes it hard to access critical medicines, daily use chemicals and other small-molecule compounds. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>Simulating a universe in which Newton&#039;s laws are only partially valid</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/02/200207124454.htm</link>
			<description>For the first time, researchers have simulated the formation of galaxies in a universe without dark matter. To replicate this process on the computer, they have instead modified Newton&#039;s laws of gravity. The galaxies that were created in the computer calculations are similar to those we actually see today. According to the scientists, their assumptions could solve many mysteries of modern cosmology. <!-- more --></description>

			<description>Controlling protein structure is crucial in the production of detergents and cosmetics. Up to now we have not had a clear understanding of how soap molecules and proteins work together to change protein structure. Now researchers have succeeded in creating a detailed picture of both unfolding and refolding of a protein by soap molecules on the millisecond timescale. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>The power of going small: Copper oxide subnanoparticle catalysts prove most superior</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/02/200207095415.htm</link>
			<description>Scientists have shown that copper oxide particles on the sub-nanoscale are more powerful catalysts than those on the nanoscale.

			<title>How iron carbenes store energy from sunlight -- and why they aren&#039;t better at it</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/02/200206155827.htm</link>
			<description>Photosensitizers absorb sunlight and pass that energy along to generate electricity or drive chemical reactions. Scientists watched what happened when light hit an inexpensive photosensitizer, iron carbene, and discovered it can respond in two competing ways, only one only one of which allows electrons to flow into the devices or reactions where they&#039;re needed. It took this desired path about 60% of the time. The ultimate goal is to design cheap photosensitizers for specific tasks that are close to 100% efficient. <!-- more --></description>

			<description>For decades, carbon nanotubes held great promise of developments in the field of electronics and more. But one drawback to realizing these innovations has been the difficulty of incorporating additional materials into nanotubes. For the first time, researchers have grown crystals of various materials uniformly onto the surface of carbon nanotubes. They hope these modified structures will exhibit functions useful in electronic, chemical or other applications. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>Fastest high-precision 3D printer</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/02/200205132251.htm</link>
			<description>3D printers working in the millimeter range and larger are increasingly used in industrial production processes. Many applications, however, require precise printing on the micrometer scale at a far higher speed. Researchers have now developed a system to print highly precise, centimeter-sized objects with submicrometer details at a so far unmatched speed. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>The shape of water: What water molecules look like on the surface of materials</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/02/200205130341.htm</link>
			<description>Water is a familiar substance that is present virtually everywhere. The properties of the first few layers of water molecules in contact with the surface of materials (called &#039;surface water&#039;) are especially important in materials science. In a recent study, scientists employed statistical data analysis tools to reveal what happens to water molecules on top of graphene. <!-- more --></description>

			<title>Fireproof, lightweight solid electrolyte for safer lithium-ion batteries</title>
			<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/02/200205084155.htm</link>
			<description>Lithium-ion batteries are in everything from cell phones to cars. However, recent incidents involving fires or explosions of these devices show there&#039;s a need for safer batteries. One option is to replace the flammable liquid electrolyte with a solid-state electrolyte (SSE). But some of the most-studied SSEs are themselves flammable, leaving the original safety concern unaddressed. Researchers now report that they have developed an SSE that won&#039;t burn up. <!-- more --></description>
